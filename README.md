## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for running MongoDB)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hrms-ai-next.git
cd hrms-ai-next
```

### 2. Set Up the Database

The application requires a running MongoDB instance. You can use Docker to easily start one:

```bash
sudo docker run -d --name my-mongodb -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Now, open `.env.local` and fill in the required values:

```
MONGODB_URI="mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/hrms-ai-next"
JWT_SECRET="your-strong-jwt-secret"
ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-32-character-long-encryption-key"
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-google-gemini-api-key"
```

### 5. Seed the Database

Populate the database with initial sample data using the seed script:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

This will create a default set of users (admin, managers, HR, employees), skills, and other necessary data. The default admin credentials are:
- **Email:** `admin@example.com`
- **Password:** `password123`

### 6. Run the Development Server

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npx next dev
```

The application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).


## üîë Demo Access & Credentials

To make it easy to explore the application's features, the database seed script creates a set of ready-to-use accounts for each user role.

**Universal Password:** `password123`

You can log in with the following accounts to experience the different dashboards and permissions:

| Role | Email | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| üßë‚Äçüíª **Admin** | `admin@example.com` | Has full system access. Can view the admin dashboard with system analytics, manage company settings, and view a comprehensive audit log of all critical actions. |
| üßë‚Äçüíº **Manager** | `manager1@example.com` | Can view the manager dashboard, which includes pending approval requests (goals, leave, etc.) from their direct reports. They can approve or deny these requests and view their team's performance goals. |
| üë©‚Äçüè´ **HR** | `hr1@example.com` | Has access to the HR dashboard to manage employee data, run payroll, manage salary structures, and use the AI Resume Screener for recruitment. |
| üë∑ **Employee** | `employee1@example.com` | Has a personal dashboard to view their profile, create and track performance goals, request leave, and view their payslips. `employee1@example.com` reports to `manager1@example.com`. |


## üìú Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run start`: Starts a production server.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
- `npm run test`: Runs the Jest test suite.
- `npm run db:seed`: Seeds the database with initial data.

## üß™ Testing

The project uses Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration testing. API route tests are located in the `__tests__` directory.

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
