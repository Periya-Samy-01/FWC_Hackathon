## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for running MongoDB)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hrms-ai-next.git
cd hrms-ai-next
```

### 2. Set Up the Database

The application requires a running MongoDB instance. You can use Docker to easily start one:

```bash
sudo docker run -d --name my-mongodb -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Now, open `.env.local` and fill in the required values:

```
MONGODB_URI="mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/hrms-ai-next"
JWT_SECRET="your-strong-jwt-secret"
ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-32-character-long-encryption-key"
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-google-gemini-api-key"
```

### 5. Seed the Database

Populate the database with initial sample data using the seed script:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

This will create a default set of users (admin, managers, HR, employees), skills, and other necessary data. The default admin credentials are:
- **Email:** `admin@example.com`
- **Password:** `password123`

### 6. Run the Development Server

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npx next dev
```

The application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## ðŸ“œ Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run start`: Starts a production server.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
- `npm run test`: Runs the Jest test suite.
- `npm run db:seed`: Seeds the database with initial data.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

The project uses Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration testing. API route tests are located in the `__tests__` directory.

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
